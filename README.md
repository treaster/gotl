# gotl: Go Template Library
Inspired by STL from C++, `gotl` provides implementations for common container types using the Go generics feature introduced in 1.18. Thus far, linked-lists and sets are supported.

Mostly this implements only the types I need for other personal projects, but if you find this and there's something you need, please create an issue, and we'll figure something out!
